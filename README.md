# SwizDAO
Built an AS3 Project to Work with GenericDAO using Swiz and AS3Signals  The project was inspired by Java Spring Framework: IBM Generic Dao  The project uses the benefits of DI provided by Swiz 1.0. The Deferred Instantiation of Swiz builds DAO Object only when [Inject] keyword is used.  Also, uses the latest Spark SkinnableComponent Framework for the View Part with passive view..
